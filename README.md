2. they should understand some of front-end web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; to communicate with team members on the front-end.<br/>
2. They work with Database alse to create, edit and save data.<br/>

## 2. Write What You know about HTTP?

- HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, it's used to deliver content like text, images, videos, etc, between the server (where the data is stored) and the client computer.

## 3. Why use a database?

- Storing data in a database reduces the load on the server CPU and allows data to be retrieved if the server crashes.
Many requests sent to the server might require a database query. A client might request information that is stored in the database, or submit data to be added to the database,
for example while log-in process.
